## This workflow is structured slightly differently than usual.
## There are three manifests:
## - a set of experimental vcfs, with unique aliases
## - a set of reference sample vcfs, with unique aliases
## - a set of comparisons between experimental and reference vcfs, referred to by their aliases from the other two manifests
## This structure is a little complicated, but is designed to keep the configuration as streamlined as possible.
## Unfortunately, these kinds of comparisons are inherently a little messy.
